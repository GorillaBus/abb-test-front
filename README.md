# Web client for ABB technical test

As focus was set on the back end this web client is just an elementary app to be able to connect to the server and watch updates in real time.

This is a "create-react-app". You should be able to run the client with just `npm start`. All other npm commands/scripts from create-react-app are available if you need them.

## Installation

`npm install`

## Running the client

With the server application running just run:

`npm start`

create-react-app's development environment will start and the app will open in a browser window. Note that you don't need to set up any http server for this to work, it's all handled by the create-react-app environment.
