# Web client for ABB technical test

As focus was set on the back end this web client is just an elementary app to be able to connect to the server and watch updates in real time.

This is a "create-react-app". You should be able to run the client with just `npm start`. All other npm commands/scripts from create-react-app are available if you need them.

Remember to start the server application first.
